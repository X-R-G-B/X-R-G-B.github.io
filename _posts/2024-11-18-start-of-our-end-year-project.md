We are happy to start our end student year project.

The goal is to make a multi-player** game using some LLM to create a new quests every time the
player end its last quests. That way, the player can keep playing the same game
without being bored or finishing the game.

We will be using Unreal Engine for the game engine, and we will try to run the
LLM on the player side, when the game will be charging.
