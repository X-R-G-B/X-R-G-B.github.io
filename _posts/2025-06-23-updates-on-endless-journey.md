Hey, the last devlog was about [how to add fog and changing the atmosphere of our game](https://x-r-g-b.github.io/blog/enhancing-atmosphere-with-fog-and-lighting-in-unreal-engine-5).
Today, it's a showcase of some features.

## Animation System

[mE0w](https://github.com/romainpanno) finished the animation system of the player. He will be soon (maybe not so soon) write a devlog about it.

## Atmosphere

The fog settings are amazing, tank you again [TTENSHII](https://github.com/TTENSHII).

## Enemies

Some enemies have spawned in the game! Different type of enemies, but we will only show one. He is waiting somewhere near the first quest :eyes:.

Again, maybe [mE0w](https://github.com/romainpanno) will make a devlog about them.

## Consumables

We added some consumables, it is not finished, but you can also see how interaction will work. When you are near an object/character that can be interacted, you will see a square, and when you focus on it, a "F" will appear to show the interact key binding.

## LLM

Thanks to [getnamo/Llama-Unreal](https://github.com/getnamo/Llama-Unreal), we can now generate text at runtime. We tested to generate new monolog for some NPC. It takes some times at each startup (5mins we a good CPU/GPU) but we will be working on distributing the works on the player in the same lobby. Also, we will maybe change the model used depending of the type of text we want to generate. We hope it will reduce the startup time.

Here is a loading screen when the LLM is generating the texts :smile:
